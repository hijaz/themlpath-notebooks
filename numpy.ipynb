    "## Introduction to NumPy\n",
    "\n",
    "NumPy (Numerical Python) is a fundamental package for scientific computing in Python. It provides support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a collection of mathematical functions to operate on these arrays.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why NumPy is Needed\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Performance**: NumPy arrays are more efficient than Python lists because they require less memory and allow faster computation.\n",
    "- **Vectorization**: NumPy allows for vectorized operations, meaning operations that can be applied element-wise without looping. This makes code cleaner and faster.\n",
    "- **Convenience**: It provides many built-in functions for linear algebra, random number generation, and basic array operations, which makes it easier to work with data at scale.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Difference Between NumPy Arrays and Python Lists\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Size**: NumPy arrays are more memory efficient than Python lists.\n",
    "2. **Speed**: Operations on NumPy arrays are faster due to optimized, compiled C code running behind the scenes.\n",
    "3. **Functionality**: NumPy arrays come with a wide variety of mathematical and statistical functions, while Python lists are limited in built-in functionality.\n",
    "\n",
    "Letâ€™s explore these differences by example.\n"
